Important Message to Customers applying updated MSFT Drivers:
 
As part of 7.12 and Phase 13 as well as future releases, the MegaRAID (MegaSas35.sys) and HBA (ItSas35.sys) drivers for Windows 10 and Windows Server have activated Microsoft security fixes. 
Users deploying these drivers need to have reviewed KB4482887 before driver upgrade/installation.
If driver upgrade/installation is performed without correct OS patch level, system crash may be experienced.
Once you have verified your OS is properly updated, the password for the MR_Win_Drv_7.12-7.712.09.00-WHQL.zip file is: “I have read and understand the attached txt file.”
